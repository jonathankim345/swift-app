<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hello! Before my interview on the XCode Development Team at Apple, I wanted to develop the capacity to become proficient quickly in Swift. Although I lacked experience with VSCode or Swift before (primarily because of my device being a Windows laptop), I still had experience with mobile and responsive application development through the use of tools like React Native and my extensive work with front-end applications. Through learning more about Swift and its unique features, I was able to compile this project which houses 40 features that I found either unique or very useful for Swift programming! I was also able to familiarize myself with the syntax, design patterns, and naming conventions through accompanying all of these features with code examples.
